# Overview.

The project is inspired to [Arcade](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade) and you intend that to avoid the tedious configuration of tools related to the development cycle such as testing, versioning, and other best practices.

This tool consists of an [MSBuild SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk) distributed through NuGet packages.

## Why you need to use or promote this in your organization.

One of the major problems that afflict the teamwork is the sharing of knowledge. This problem is hugely amplified when your organization has multiple teams.
Commonly the communication across teams is poor and this often leads to reinventing the wheel, or when to the things go in well mode the copy and paste is accepts as the "non plus ultra" solution. 

For this reason, the milestones of MsBullet SDK are:

 - being able to share functionality across team and repo is one of the peace to grow and increase the organization's revenues.
 - offer to dev and team or repo owners a modular and sustainable solution to manage what tools that are needed, and which aren't, for yours daily work.
